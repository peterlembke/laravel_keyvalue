# Controllers

You can browser to Laravel with routes.
See routes/web.php

A route can be connected to a controller.
A controller can have one or more controller actions (public functions)

Documentation: [Controller](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/controllers)

Please use Controllers __instead__ of using a closure in the routes/web.php class.
